So what should I plan to turn in for homework-1:
Hand written work:
  Q1 
    Taylor expansions about x0 (to 4th order + remainder)
    Expand g
    Expand g^
    Show g is 2nd-order accurate
    Show c^=(g−g^)/3 estimates f′′(x0)−g
    Show (f′′(x0)−g)−c^=O(h3)
  Q2
    Exact derivative for error computation
    Reference output to check
  Q3
    Put the ODE in standard form
    Grid notation
    Forward Euler (explicit Euler) update
    Backward Euler (implicit Euler) update
    Exact solution check
  Q4
    Interior discretization at a generic xi, i=1,…,n−1
    Left boundary condition 3y(0)+y′(0)=5 with forward difference
    Right boundary condition y′(2)=7 with backward difference
    Final discrete system structure and what my derivation implies
